## Callback

### POST `/api/onlyoffice/callback`

OnlyOffice callback endpoint. Called by the OnlyOffice Document Server when document state changes.

**Request Body:**
OnlyOffice callback data including `status`, `key`, `url`, and `forcesavetype`.

**Callback Statuses:**

| Status | Meaning                                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | Document is being edited                                  |
| 2      | Document is ready for saving (all users closed)           |
| 3      | Document saving error                                     |
| 4      | Document closed with no changes                           |
| 6      | Document is being edited, current state saved (forcesave) |

**Forcesave Types (when status = 6):**

| Type | Trigger                                     |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Command service request (auto-save service) |
| 1    | Save button click (Ctrl+S)                  |
| 2    | Timer-based (autoAssembly)                  |
| 3    | Form submission                             |

**Response:**

```json
{
  "error": 0
}
```

**Note:** `error: 0` must always be returned, even on internal errors. Otherwise OnlyOffice will retry indefinitely.

## Auto-Save

Documents are saved to storage periodically while being edited, not just on close.

**How it works:**

1. When a document is opened (via viewer or config endpoint), it is registered with the auto-save service.
2. Every 30 seconds, the backend sends a `forcesave` command to the OnlyOffice Document Server command service API (`/coauthoring/CommandService.ashx`).
3. OnlyOffice responds by calling the callback endpoint with status 6 and `forcesavetype: 0`.
4. The callback handler downloads the current document and writes it to storage.
5. When all users close the document (status 2 or 4), it is unregistered from auto-save.

**Editor configuration:**

The editor config includes `customization.forcesave: true`, which also allows manual saves via Ctrl+S or the save button without closing the document.

**Command service request format:**

```json
{
  "c": "forcesave",
  "key": "userId-fileId-timestamp"
}
```

When JWT is enabled, the payload is signed and sent as `{ "token": "signed_jwt" }`.
