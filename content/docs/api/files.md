File management endpoints for TMA Cloud.

**Note:** All endpoints that accept `ids` arrays process multiple files in bulk operations. This includes move, copy, star, share, delete, restore, and download operations.

## Account Scope and Permissions

File endpoints operate on the caller's **account**, not on the individual login. An account owner and its sub-users read and write the same files, folders and storage quota.

Listing, searching, and reading file details are available to every member of an account. The remaining endpoints require a permission, which owners always hold and sub-users are granted individually:

| Permission       | Endpoints                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `files.download` | `GET /:id/download`, `POST /download/bulk`                                                                   |
| `files.upload`   | `POST /folder`, `POST /upload`, `POST /upload/bulk`, `POST /upload/check`, `POST /copy`, `POST /:id/derived` |
| `files.edit`     | `POST /move`, `POST /rename`, `POST /star`, `POST /:id/replace`                                              |
| `files.share`    | `POST /share`, `POST /share/links`, `POST /link-parent-share`                                                |
| `files.delete`   | `POST /delete`                                                                                               |
| `files.trash`    | `POST /trash/restore`, `POST /trash/delete`, `POST /trash/empty`                                             |

A request without the required permission returns `403` with a message naming it:

```json
{
  "message": "You do not have permission to do that. Ask the account owner to enable \"Upload & create\"."
}
```

The check runs before the request body is read, so a rejected upload does not transfer its file. See [Authorization](/docs/concepts/authorization).

## List Files

### GET `/api/files`

List files and folders.

**Query Parameters:**

- `parentId` - Parent folder ID (optional)
- `sortBy` - Sort field: `name`, `size`, `modified`, `accessedAt`, `deletedAt` (optional, defaults to `modified`)
- `order` - Sort order: `asc`, `desc` (optional, defaults to `desc`)

Any other `sortBy` value is ignored and the default is used. `deletedAt` is only meaningful on `/api/files/trash`.

**Response:**

An array of file and folder objects.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "file_123",
    "name": "document.pdf",
    "type": "file",
    "size": 1024,
    "mimeType": "application/pdf",
    "parentId": "folder_456",
    "starred": false,
    "modified": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "accessedAt": "2024-01-02T09:15:00Z"
  }
]
```

**`accessedAt`:** When the item was last read. Listing a folder updates that folder's own `accessedAt`, not the entries returned. The value is approximate — it is written at most once per hour per item and may lag by the cache TTL of this response. See [File System](/docs/concepts/file-system#last-access-time).

## File Statistics

### GET `/api/files/stats`

Get file statistics for the current user.

**Response fields:**

- `totalFiles` — total number of files owned by the user
- `totalFolders` — total number of folders owned by the user
- `sharedCount` — number of share links the user has created (not items shared _with_ the user)
- `starredCount` — number of files/folders the user has starred

```json
{
  "totalFiles": 100,
  "totalFolders": 50,
  "sharedCount": 10,
  "starredCount": 25
}
```

## Search Files

### GET `/api/files/search`

Search files.

**Query Parameters:**

- `q` or `query` - Search query (required)
- `limit` - Result limit (optional)

**Response:**

An array of file and folder objects matching the search query.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "file_123",
    "name": "document.pdf",
    "type": "file",
    "size": 1024,
    "mimeType": "application/pdf",
    "parentId": "folder_456",
    "starred": false,
    "modified": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "accessedAt": "2024-01-02T09:15:00Z"
  }
]
```

Searching does not count as reading. The `accessedAt` values returned are unchanged by the search itself.

## Create Folder

### POST `/api/files/folder`

Create a new folder.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "name": "New Folder",
  "parent_id": "parent_folder_id"
}
```

**Validation:**

- `name`: Required. Must not be empty after trimming. Max length 100. Any character is allowed except control characters and `/ \ : * ? " < > |`, so spaces, accents, and non-Latin scripts are accepted.
- `parentId`: Optional. Must be a string.

**Response:**

The created folder object.

```json
{
  "id": "folder_123",
  "name": "New Folder",
  "type": "folder",
  "size": null,
  "modified": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Check Upload Storage

### POST `/api/files/upload/check`

Check if the user has enough storage space for an upload before sending the file.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "fileSize": 1024
}
```

**Validation:**

- `fileSize`: Required. Must be a non-negative integer representing the file size in bytes.

**Response (Success):**

```json
{
  "message": "Storage space available"
}
```

**Response (Error):**

```json
{
  "message": "Storage limit exceeded. Required: 1 GB, available: 500 MB."
}
```

## Upload File

### POST `/api/files/upload`

Upload a file.

**Form Data:**

- `file` - File to upload (required)
- `parent_id` - Parent folder ID (optional)
- `path` - Target path (optional)

**MIME Type Validation:**

- The actual MIME type is detected from the file's content (magic bytes).
- The stored MIME type will always match the actual file content, even if the file extension is different.

**Duplicate names:** If a file with the same name already exists in the parent folder, the server assigns a unique display name (e.g. `document (1).pdf`). The client can instead overwrite the existing file by calling `POST /api/files/:id/replace` with the existing file's ID.

**Response:**

The uploaded file object.

**Client abort:** If the client cancels the request, the server returns HTTP 499 with `error: "REQUEST_ABORTED"` and `message: "Upload cancelled by client"`

```json
{
  "id": "file_123",
  "name": "uploaded_file.pdf",
  "type": "file",
  "size": 1024,
  "mimeType": "application/pdf",
  "parentId": null,
  "modified": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Bulk Upload Files

### POST `/api/files/upload/bulk`

Upload multiple files at once using `multipart/form-data`.

**Form Data:**

- `files` - Files to upload (required)
- `parent_id` - Parent folder ID (optional)
- `path` - Target path (optional)
- `relativePaths` - Optional. One value per file, same order as `files`. When present, the server uses these relative paths (e.g. `"MyFolder/sub/file.txt"`) to recreate folder structure under `parent_id`.
- `clientIds` - Optional. One value per file, same order as `files`. Echoed back in the response for easier client-side matching.

**Duplicate names:** For each file, if a file with the same name already exists in the parent folder, the server assigns a unique display name (e.g. `document (1).pdf`).

**Response:**

On success, returns a summary object. `files` contains created file records; `failed` contains per-file errors (if any).

**Client abort:** If the client cancels the request (e.g. user clicks Cancel upload), the server returns HTTP 499 with `error: "REQUEST_ABORTED"` and `message: "Upload cancelled by client"`

```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "id": "file_123",
      "name": "file1.pdf",
      "type": "file",
      "size": 1024,

    }
  ],
  "failed": [
    {
      "fileName": "bad-file.exe",
      "error": "Invalid file type",

Download a single file or a folder (folders are returned as a ZIP archive).

**Validation:**

- `id`: Required. Must be a string.

**Response:**

Downloading marks the item as read. For a folder, the folder and every entry in the archive are marked. See [Last Access Time](/docs/concepts/file-system#last-access-time).

## Get File or Folder Info

### GET `/api/files/:id/info`

Get basic metadata for a single file or folder.

**Path Parameters:**

- `id` - File or folder ID (required)

**Response (file):**

```json
{
  "id": "file_123",
  "name": "document.pdf",
  "type": "file",
  "size": 1024,
  "modified": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "accessedAt": "2024-01-02T09:15:00Z",
  "parentId": "folder_456"
}
```

**Response (folder):**

```json
{
  "id": "folder_123",
  "name": "Reports",
  "type": "folder",
  "size": null,
  "modified": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "accessedAt": "2024-01-02T09:15:00Z",
  "parentId": null,
  "folderInfo": {
    "totalSize": 1048576,
    "fileCount": 25,
    "folderCount": 3
  }
}
```

- `size` and `folderInfo.totalSize` are in bytes.
- For folders, `size` may be `null`; use `folderInfo.totalSize` for the recursive size.
- `accessedAt` is the last read time. Calling this endpoint does not update it.

**Errors:**

- `404` - File or folder not found or not owned by the user

## Replace File Contents

### POST `/api/files/:id/replace`

Replace the contents of an existing file. The file ID and name stay the same; size, modified time and last access time are updated. Used when the user chooses "Replace the File" for a duplicate-name upload, and by the Windows desktop app when syncing edits from Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or other desktop editors.

**Path Parameters:**

- `id` - File ID (required)

**Form Data:**

- `file` - New file content (required). Single file in `multipart/form-data`.

**Validation:**

- The file must exist and belong to the authenticated user.
- MIME type is detected from file content. Stored MIME type is updated to match.

**Response:**

The updated file object.

```json
{
  "id": "file_123",
  "name": "document.docx",
  "type": "file",
  "size": 2048,
  "mimeType": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document",
  "parentId": "folder_456",
  "starred": false,
  "modified": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

**Errors:**

- `404` - File not found or not owned by the user
- `400` - No file in request or invalid file type

## Upload Derived File (e.g. Exported Document/PDF)

### POST `/api/files/:id/derived`

Upload a new file that is derived from an existing one while keeping the original file unchanged. This is used by the Windows desktop app when a user opens a document via **Open on desktop** and then uses **Save As** or **Export** (for example, exporting a Word document to PDF or saving a copy as `.docx`, `.xlsx`, or `.pptx`).

The new file is created as a separate entry in the same folder as the original file.

**Path Parameters:**

- `id` - Source file ID (required). The new file is created as a sibling of this file.

**Form Data (local / non-S3 deployments):**

- `file` - Derived file content (required). Single file in `multipart/form-data`.

**S3-backed deployments:**

- When `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3`, uploads are streamed and `streamUploadToS3` sets `req.streamedUpload`. The desktop client sends the same `multipart/form-data` request; the server handles streaming and metadata creation.

**Validation:**

- The source file must exist and belong to the authenticated user.
- The derived file name must be a valid file name.
- MIME type is detected from file content and stored accordingly.
- Storage quota and max upload size checks apply in the same way as for normal uploads.

**Response:**

The created file object for the derived file. Common use cases include exported PDFs and alternate Office document formats saved from Word, Excel, or PowerPoint.

```json
{
  "id": "file_derived_123",
  "name": "document.pdf",
  "type": "file",
  "size": 4096,
  "mimeType": "application/pdf",
  "parentId": "folder_456",
  "starred": false,
  "modified": "2024-01-01T12:05:00Z"
}
```

**Errors:**

- `404` - Source file not found or not owned by the user
- `400` - No file in request or invalid file type
- `413` - Storage limit exceeded

## Bulk Download Files

### POST `/api/files/download/bulk`

Download multiple files and/or folders as a single ZIP archive.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "ids": ["file_123", "file_456", "folder_789"]
}
```

**Validation:**

- `ids`: Required. Must be a non-empty array of strings.

**Response:**
A ZIP archive containing all selected files and folders.

**Note:** For single file downloads, use the GET endpoint. This endpoint is optimized for downloading multiple items at once.

## File Events

### GET `/api/files/events`

Establish a real-time event stream (Server-Sent Events) for file system changes. Requires Redis to be configured.

**Response:**
A Server-Sent Events stream.
