Optional Windows desktop client for TMA Cloud. Loads the same web app from your server URL; no separate frontend build.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v25+)
- **TMA Cloud server** running and reachable (e.g. `https://your-tma-cloud.example.com`)
- **npm**

## Run from Source

Useful for development or testing without building an installer.

1. Clone the repo and go to the Electron app:

   ```bash
   cd electron
   npm install
   ```

2. Set the server URL. Create `electron/src/config/build-config.json` (copy from `src/config/build-config.example.json` if present) with:

   ```json
   {
     "serverUrl": "https://your-tma-cloud.example.com",
     "updatorUrl": ""
   }
   ```

   Replace `serverUrl` with your TMA Cloud URL. `updatorUrl` is optional. Set it to the base URL where installers are hosted so the app can download updates (installer URL: `<updatorUrl>/v<version>`).

3. Start the app:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The window opens and loads the server URL. If `serverUrl` is missing, the app shows a "Server URL not configured" page.

## Build Installer (Windows)

Builds a Windows installer with the server URL embedded so users do not need a config file.

**Admin privilege required:** Run your terminal (or IDE) **as Administrator** when building.

1. In `electron/`, ensure `src/config/build-config.json` exists and contains your `serverUrl`. Set `updatorUrl` to the base URL for installer downloads if you want the packaged app to offer in-app desktop updates.

2. Run the build:

   ```bash
   npm run build:client
   ```

   This runs `prepare-client-build.js` (copies `src/main` and `src/preload` into `dist-electron/` and injects `serverUrl` into main config), then `build-clouddrive.js` (compiles the [Cloud Drive](#cloud-drive-mounted-windows-drive) host and bundles the WinFsp installer), then runs electron-builder. Output is in `electron/dist-client/` (NSIS installer by default).

   The Cloud Drive host is a .NET project (`desktop-fs`), so building the installer also requires the **.NET SDK (9+)**. The WinFsp redistributable is downloaded and verified automatically at build time.

3. For a portable executable (no installer):

   ```bash
   npm run build:client:win:portable
   ```

4. For an unpacked folder (no installer, run exe from folder):

   ```bash
   npm run build:client:win:unpacked
   ```

Builds are unsigned by default. To sign the app, configure code signing and use the same `build:client` flow.

## Install on Windows

- **NSIS installer:** Run the `.exe` from `dist-client/`. Choose installation directory and complete the wizard.
- **Portable:** Copy the portable build and run the executable. No install step.
- **Unpacked:** Run the executable inside the unpacked folder.

The server URL is embedded at build time only. No config file is needed after install.

## Version and updates

- The desktop app version comes from `electron/package.json` and is shown under **Settings → Updates → Desktop app**.
- The app uses the same update feed as the web UI (`/api/version/latest`), which returns `frontend`, `backend`, and `electron` versions.
- When any signed-in user opens the app (web or desktop), a one-time background check compares the current versions to the feed.
- If any component is outdated, an **Updates Available** notice appears in the left sidebar above **Settings**, listing the latest versions for backend, frontend, and Electron.
- **Desktop (Electron) updates:** When the Electron version is outdated and `updatorUrl` was set at build time, a download icon appears next to **Electron** in that section. Any signed-in user can click it to download the update. After the download finishes, the installer is launched and the app quits so the user can complete setup. If `updatorUrl` is not configured, the sidebar still shows the latest version but the download action is not available.

## Active desktop clients (admin view)

- Signed-in desktop clients send periodic heartbeats to the backend.
- The admin can view active clients in **Settings → Administration → Active Desktop Clients**.
- Each row includes user, platform, app version, IP, and last seen time.
- Revoking sessions removes related heartbeat rows; stale rows are also purged automatically.

## Desktop Editing and Open on Desktop (Windows)

When you run the Windows desktop app, you can open supported files in their desktop applications and have changes sync back automatically.

- **Supported:** `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.pdf`, and other types that Windows can open (including common image and video formats)
- **Where it works:** Electron desktop app on Windows only

### Open on Desktop

- Right-click a supported file (document, image, or video) → **Open on desktop**
- Double-click behavior in the desktop app:
  - Office/OnlyOffice-supported files open in the default desktop application
  - Image and video files open in the default viewer for that type
- A progress indicator (e.g. "Opening file… X%") appears while the file is prepared. Clicking the same file again while it is opening shows "Already opening this file on desktop. Please wait...".

### How Sync Works

- The desktop app downloads an encrypted copy of the file to a temporary location (or reuses a copy for large files when the cloud version is unchanged).
- The file is opened using the default application registered in Windows (for example, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or another associated editor).
- While the file is open, the desktop app watches it for changes.
- When you press **Save** in the desktop editor, the updated content is uploaded back to TMA Cloud in the background.
- The same file entry is updated (ID stays the same); the modified time and size reflect the new version.

If you open a document and close it without saving, no upload is performed and the stored version is unchanged.

- **Caching for large files:** For files of about 6 MB or more, the desktop app may reuse a previously downloaded copy from the same session instead of re-downloading. Before reuse, it checks the current file size and modification time from the server and the copy is reused only if both match. If the file was changed on the server (for example by another device or user), it is re-downloaded.

### Save As / Export (derived files)

When you use **Save As** or **Export** in a desktop editor (for example, Word → Export to PDF or save a copy as `.docx`) while the file was opened via **Open on desktop**:

- If the new file (for example, `report.pdf` or `report-copy.docx`) is saved into the same temporary folder that the desktop app used for the original file, the desktop app:
  - Detects the new file (supported document and export formats such as `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.csv`, `.rtf`, and similar).
  - Uploads it as a **new file** in the same cloud folder as the original document.
  - Shows a status toast such as `Saving exported file "report......pdf" (12.3 MB)` and `Exported file "report......pdf"` when complete.
- Large exports may take time and the file list updates automatically when the upload finishes.
- If you choose a different location (for example, Desktop or Documents) in the Save As dialog, the file is saved **only** on your computer and is **not** uploaded automatically.

## Cloud Drive (mounted Windows drive)

The Windows desktop app can mount TMA Cloud as a drive (for example `Z:`) so you can open and save files from the file dialogs of any application — WhatsApp, Telegram, Outlook, Office, browsers, and so on. It appears under **This PC** like OneDrive or Dropbox and keeps nothing on disk except a temporary cache.

- **Requires WinFsp.** The drive is backed by [WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev), a user-mode filesystem driver for Windows ("WinFsp - Windows File System Proxy, Copyright (C) Bill Zissimopoulos"). The installer installs it silently if it is not already present; the user does not need to do anything.
- **Mounts automatically.** The drive appears a second or two after you sign in and is removed when you sign out or close the app. It reuses the app's existing session — no separate login.
- **Save As anywhere.** In any app's Save dialog, choose the TMA Cloud drive as the destination. The file uploads through the same pipeline as a normal upload, so permissions, versioning, and audit all apply. Saving into an existing subfolder reuses that folder instead of creating a duplicate.
- **Live updates.** Changes made from the web app or another device appear on the drive within a few seconds.

### Save-only mode

**Settings → Storage → Cloud Drive → Save-only mode** (desktop app only).

- **Off (default):** files can be opened and copied from the drive normally.
- **On:** folders and files stay browsable and **Save As** still works, but opening or copying file content from the drive is blocked (Windows shows "Access denied"). Use this to keep people opening files through the app while still allowing Save As uploads.

The toggle applies immediately and is remembered per device.

## Clipboard Integration (Windows desktop app)

The Windows desktop app uses a single Copy / Cut / Paste model that bridges the cloud and OS clipboards. One Copy covers both in-app pastes and Explorer pastes, and Paste figures out the right source automatically.

### Context Menu

- **Copy:** Right-click one or more items → **Copy**. The selection goes to the in-app clipboard immediately so you can paste it into another folder inside TMA Cloud, and (in the desktop app) it is also written to the Windows clipboard in the background so you can paste in Explorer. Files larger than 200 MB total and folders are kept on the in-app clipboard only — those still paste between folders in TMA Cloud, but Explorer pastes are skipped. The toast tells you which path applied.
- **Cut:** Right-click → **Cut**. In-app only. Cut items show a Windows-Explorer-style faded look until paste completes.
- **Paste:** Right-click in a folder → **Paste**. If you copied or cut something inside TMA Cloud, the cloud clipboard is used (server-side copy/move — no re-upload). Otherwise files on the Windows clipboard are uploaded into the current folder. If you copy something in Explorer after a cloud Copy, Paste detects the change and uses the newer Windows-clipboard files instead.

The OS clipboard side of Paste supports Explorer copy, Outlook attachments, Snipping Tool, the OLE file clipboard used by other apps, and clipboard text containing file paths (e.g. Copy as path, IDE "Copy path/reference").

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+A / Cmd+A:** Select all files and folders in the current view.
- **Ctrl+C / Cmd+C:** Unified Copy (cloud clipboard + Windows clipboard when files fit).
- **Ctrl+X / Cmd+X:** Cut (cloud clipboard only).
- **Ctrl+V / Cmd+V:** Smart Paste — cloud clipboard first, otherwise upload from the Windows clipboard.
- **Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Shift+I:** Open **Get Info** for the currently selected file or folder (desktop app only and single selection).

## Folder navigation (back/forward)

In the Windows desktop app, the file manager supports back/forward folder navigation.

- **Toolbar:** Back and Forward buttons appear in the file manager header (left of the breadcrumbs). They move through the folder history.
- **Mouse:** Mouse back/forward (side buttons, e.g. typical browser back/forward) trigger folder back/forward when the file manager is in use. They are ignored when the pointer is over an input, textarea, select, or a dialog.

Navigation history is updated when you open a folder, click a breadcrumb, or go to **My Files**. Forward history is cleared when you navigate to a new folder.

## Desktop-only mode (optional)

- When the administrator enables **Desktop app only access** in **Settings → Administration** from the desktop app, the backend rejects browser access to the main app.
- The desktop app continues to work because it sends the required HTTP header on its requests.
- Share links (`/s/*`), `/health`, and `/metrics` still respond as normal.
- Browsers that open the main URL see a simple page stating that the instance is configured for desktop app access only.
