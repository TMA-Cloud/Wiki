Troubleshooting file upload problems.

## Upload Failures

### File Not Uploading

**Check:**

1. Storage limit not exceeded
2. File size within max upload size (admin-configurable in **Settings** → **Storage**)
3. Network connection stable
4. Disk space available

### Storage Limit

**Solutions:**

1. Check current storage usage
2. Delete unnecessary files
3. Empty trash
4. Admin: Increase storage limit

### File Too Large

The file exceeds the max upload size setting.

**Solutions:**

1. Check the current max upload size in **Settings** → **Storage**
2. Admin: Increase the max upload size
3. Split the file into smaller parts

## Upload Errors

### "Storage limit exceeded"

**Solutions:**

1. Free up storage space
2. Delete old files
3. Empty trash permanently
4. Admin: Increase storage limit (if custom limit set)
5. Check actual disk space available

### "Upload failed"

**Check:**

1. File size limits
2. Disk space: `df -h`
3. File permissions on upload directory
4. Network connectivity
5. MIME type detection (file content must be readable)

### "Upload cancelled by client" (499 REQUEST_ABORTED)

Returned when the user cancels an upload. The request is aborted before completion. Partial temp files on disk will be removed by the system. This is expected behavior, not an error

### Folder uploads missing files

- Confirm the browser supports folder upload (Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers)
- Check that the selected folder actually contains the missing files (some apps create links or placeholders that are not real files)
- Look in **Audit Logs** for `file.upload.bulk` events to see how many files were processed.
- If only some files failed, check the `failed` entries returned by `POST /api/files/upload/bulk`

## File Permissions

### Permission Denied

**Solutions:**

1. Check upload directory permissions
2. Verify user has write access
3. Docker: Check volume mount permissions
4. Set correct ownership: `chown -R user:user uploads/`
